# Caleb Rickenbach - Personal Portfolio

A minimal, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing my experience across embedded systems hardware, secure firmware, and modern full-stack application development. 

Built to highlight projects like Cowbell and FeederAce, and to demonstrate my proficiency in both low-level hardware engineering and cross-platform design.
